## :scroll: Description
This is the challenge for week 3. The goal is to design based on the spec given. For more detail: https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/03/android-dev-challenge-3.html
The design is for both light and dark theme.

## :bulb: Motivation and Context
This challenge help me to think the way compose work from design to development.
Here are some issues I faced:
- Sometime, dark theme preview not change color or image resource despite multiple refresh (it still takes color from light)
- Android studio not responding
  - when try to run preview on device, scanning file index
  - when initializing preview 
- Preview is not showing when I set status bar transparent or hide system UI in code
- Android Studio is slow when render multiple preview. (I noticed when I have four previews)
